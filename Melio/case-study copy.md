## Overview and Origin

* **Company name:** Melio

* **Founded in** 2018, Isreal. Offices in Tel Aviv & New York.

* **Founders:** Ilan Atias (CTO), Matan Bar (CEO), Ziv Paz (COO)

* **Idea** - Matan Bar previously ran PayPal’s business unit focused on peer-to-peer payments, which included Venmo in the U.S. and equivalent services (not branded Venmo) outside of it. He came to PayPal, which at the time was a part of eBay, through eBay’s acquisition of his previous startup, a social gifting platform called The Gifts Project.

    As Bar describes it, PayPal “was the first time I experienced what the digitization of payments looked like as they were shifting from cash to mobile payments. Consumers were buying online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores, and even when they were getting physical items, they were paying online.” What he quickly realized, though, was that the same was not applying to the businesses themselves.

    “There are still trillions being transferred via paper checks in the B2B space,” he said, with paper invoices and paper checks dominating the market. “The space is way behind other payment areas. I would be talking with SMB owners who would be using fancy Square or PayPal point of sale devices, but when they had to pay, say, a coffee bean supplier, they stuffed checks in envelopes. That’s very intriguing obviously, and it triggered our interest.”

* **Funding:** Melio has raised a total of $254M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 25, 2021 from a Series C round, $110M at a valuation of $1.3B.

## Recommendations

**Product recommenations** 

* Cashflow management - an interesting feature to be added so businesses can forecast when they would be cashflow negative.

* Revenue streams - currently the business only has one income stream which is the 2.9% fee when paying by credit card. This could be risky if a competitor is able to undercut them by price. 

* Smart contracts (via Blockchain) - a larger company vision could be to facilitate B2B business transactions. Being able to close contracts digitally and have them stored via Blockchain could be a good product extension as well as revenue extension. 

**Reviews**

* Google maps - poor rating (2.6) 
* Trustpilot reviews on homepage - update them to real time
* G2crowd - increaser number of reviews (currently 1)
